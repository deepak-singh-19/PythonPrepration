#  Typecasting - The conversion of one data type into another data type is known as type casting or type conversion in Python
#  Typecasting - Typecasting is process of converting a value of one data type to another datatype. (string, int, float, boolean)

print(int(a)+int(b))

# str="10"
# str1="20"
# print(int(str) +int(str1))

# str = "18"
# number = 7
# str_number = int(str)
# sum = number + str_number
# print("The sum of the both number is:", sum)
